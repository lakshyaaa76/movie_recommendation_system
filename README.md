## 📂 Dataset & Posters  

Since the dataset source website is blocked in my country, I downloaded the CSV files and posters manually.  
You can access them here:  

👉 [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MzjXCZ5idXk83v7jcHpRGVf4l6gD6wOA?usp=drive_link)  

Make sure to:  
1. Download the **CSV files** and place them in your project folder.  
2. Download the **posters folder** and put it inside the project (e.g., `posters/`).
